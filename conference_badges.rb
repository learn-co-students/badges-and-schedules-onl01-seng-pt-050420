      # Question 4
    # The method `printer` should output first the results of the batch_badge_creator method and then of the assign_rooms method to the screen - this way you can output
    # the badges and room assignments one at a time.
    # To make this test pass, make sure you are iterating through your badges and room assignments lists.

    # it 'should puts the list of badges and room_assignments' do
    #   badges_and_room_assignments.each_line do |line|
        # $stdout is a Ruby global varibale that represents the current standard output.
        # In this case, the standard output is your terminal screen. This test, then,
        # is checking to see whether or not your terminal screen receives the correct
        # printed output.
#         expect($stdout).to receive(:puts).with(line.chomp)
#       end
#       printer(attendees)
